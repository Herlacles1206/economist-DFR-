It helps to co-ordinate the workflow of collecting rollouts and optimizing the various policies via a reinforcement learning algorithm. Inherently, RLlib maintains a wide suite of [algorithms](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/rllib-algorithms.html) for multi-agent learning (which was another strong reason for us to consider using RLlib) - available options include SAC, PPO, PG, A2C, A3C, IMPALA, ES, DDPG, DQN, MARWIL, APEX, and APEX_DDPG.
